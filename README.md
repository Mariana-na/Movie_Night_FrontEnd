MOVIE NIGHT

Movie Night is a fun and intuitive app that aims to bring a sense of spontaneity to it's user's film evenings.

With a click of a button Movie Night will give you great film suggestions to watch as well as a delicious meal to pair it with. Then all the user has to do is fill in the where, when and who they might want to invite and create the event.

This project was developed as part of a learning exercise at IronHack web development bootcamp. It being our team's first full stack porject, we faced plenty of challenges that undoubtably contributed for a great learning curve.

The implementation of three database models with at least two relations between them was time consuming and required good strategy planning from the get go.

Furthermore, the information presented to the user is collected in part from a local database and in part from an API. The use of an external source brought its own set of challenges given the additional research that is necessary in order to ensure the data can behave according to our requirements and expectations.

To manage the data requests between the client and server was a true test to how well we understood the logic behind the code's behaviour and offered intense practice of our debugging skills. 

The token validation using JWT proved itself a complex topic to manipulate confidently. However, once past the initial learning period, we were quick to understand and appreciate the benefits it provides to the code organisation.

Given the learning scope of this project and its short timeframe, there are a lot of features left on hold for future improvement. Some of these are the implementation of search refinement tools, to allow the user to limit through the possible results; the addition of different databases for different types of features, such as drinks and board games; and the implementation of atendance buttons that allow the creator of the event to have a clearer idea of how many guests to expect.
